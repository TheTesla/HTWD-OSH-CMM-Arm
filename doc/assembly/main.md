# Arm Assembly

The core strategic asset behind open source instrumentation equipment is the adaptability. This manual shows the basic mounting concept and one possible setup of the arm mechanics. If it is built up with different dimensions, the calibration values in the firmware must be changed!

## Joints

To address the flexibility requirement, there are only a few amount of different parts, which are identical for each joint.

The optical rotary encoders are mounted into the `encodermountI_4` brick by three screws. The screws are normally included with the deilvery of the rotary encoder. There are six holes in the encoder. The three outer holes must be used. There is only one valid position, because the cable must fit into the large notch.

After the screws are tightened, the mounting brackets `notched_screwbarI_4` for the shaft can be fitted. For each encoder two identical parts are used. The notches of the two bricks will embrace the shaft of the encoder. It is easier to align the two parts without the encoder and combine them with one screw at first. There must not be any gap. The two bricks can be rotatetaround the screw like a pair of scissors. The assembly can now be put on the encoder shaft and a second screw must be added. At the end, both screws must be fully tigthened to make sure, the mounting brackets don't move on the shaft. Make sure, there are 1 - 2 mm spacing between the brackets and the three metal screws to avoid scrubbing or blocking.

One joint is ready now. Repeat this procedure for the other four joint.
